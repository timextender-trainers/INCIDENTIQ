# IncidentIQ: AI-Powered Interactive Security Training Platform

## üö® The Growing Threat Landscape

In today's digital age, cybercriminals are leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly amplify their attack capabilities. These AI-powered threats are becoming more sophisticated, personalized, and successful than ever before:

- **Increased Attack Volume**: LLMs enable hackers to generate thousands of convincing phishing emails, social engineering scripts, and malicious content at unprecedented scale. CrowdStrike's 2025 Global Threat Report shows a 442% surge in vishing (voice phishing) attacks in the second half of 2024, demonstrating the rapid scaling capabilities of AI-enhanced attacks.

- **Enhanced Success Rates**: AI-crafted attacks are more persuasive, using natural language processing to create contextually relevant and psychologically manipulative content. Microsoft Threat Intelligence reports that North Korean actors like Jasper Sleet are leveraging AI to improve both the scale and sophistication of their operations since 2024.

- **Adaptive Strategies**: Hackers use LLMs to analyze target organizations and craft highly personalized attack vectors that exploit specific vulnerabilities. The 2025 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report indicates that 79% of detections were malware-free, showing attackers are increasingly using sophisticated social engineering and AI-powered techniques rather than traditional malware.

## ÔøΩ The Problem with Traditional Security Training

Current security training approaches are fundamentally broken:

- **Passive Video Content**: Most organizations rely on static video modules that employees passively consume, leading to minimal engagement and poor retention
- **One-Size-Fits-All**: Generic training materials fail to address specific roles, industries, or individual learning styles
- **Forgettable Experience**: Studies show that employees forget up to 80% of security training content within a week of completion
- **No Real-World Practice**: Traditional training lacks hands-on experience with actual attack scenarios, leaving employees unprepared for real threats
- **Checkbox Mentality**: Training becomes a compliance exercise rather than meaningful skill development
- **Static Content**: Training materials quickly become outdated as cyber threats evolve rapidly
