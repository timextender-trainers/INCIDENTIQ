# IncidentIQ: AI-Powered Interactive Security Training Platform

## üö® The Growing Threat Landscape

In today's digital age, cybercriminals are leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly amplify their attack capabilities. These AI-powered threats are becoming more sophisticated, personalized, and successful than ever before:

- **Increased Attack Volume**: LLMs enable hackers to generate thousands of convincing phishing emails, social engineering scripts, and malicious content at unprecedented scale
- **Enhanced Success Rates**: AI-crafted attacks are more persuasive, using natural language processing to create contextually relevant and psychologically manipulative content
- **Adaptive Strategies**: Hackers use LLMs to analyze target organizations and craft highly personalized attack vectors that exploit specific vulnerabilities
